This was a team project, not solo work. I have removed commits and names for privacy reasons.

What I did on this project:
This was an application that used Java, JavaScript, and Angular. It contained a method to order food 
items, which were pulled from the SQL DB. The customer would choose items and enter their name 
and address. There was also another section of the application for which I was responsible for. It 
was for employees so they could view orders, search for them, sort the table, and mark the order as 
finished or delete it outright. 

TECH USED: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, MySQL, Slack
Responsibilities: Employee Dashboard, API Calls, Major Springboot sections (Controllers, Repos, 
Models, etc)

The below readme was not written by me.
